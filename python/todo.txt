--urgent--
try to convert Item/Potion/Equipment/Jewel classes into json arrays or dict
(this may be a major change for the rest of the program, so it must be done before others)
(This is now handled by shops.py)


--code--
test code with pytest (low)
replace constants STATLIST, GENERALS and EQUIPGENERALS by a for boucle (will not be used after the use of json)
add tests for Equipment, Jewel, PassiveBoost (with a real owner), etc.
(no more test for now)
try to make an independant Jewel class (which inherits from Item) (useless after json)

--features--
add npcs, players, etc.
add entity class
add monsters
add map

--specific---
Entity class must have a "passives" PassiveSkill list attribute
Entity class must raise a ManaError exception when trying to remove more mana than possible, or the skills must prevent this
